# nw-hacks-pill-dispenser
Project submission for nwHacks 2023. Smart pill dispenser that reminds you to take medication, dispenses pills, and keeps track of expiry dates and temperature & humidity conditions. 

- The pill dispenser provides an auditory reminder to take medication/supplements at scheduled intervals
- It dispenses one pill at a time using a sonar sensor to detect the pill that falls into the container and prevent further dispensing of pills
- It displays temperature and humidity for constant moderation of weather conditions
- Displays expiry date so you’ll never forget about it

How it works:
1. Carefully insert pills into the tube, and input medication information on the website (name, expiry date, recurrence, optimal temperature & humidity)
2. When the time comes to take your medication, our cutting edge Motor TechnologyTM comes into play. The servo motor will shake the tube so that ONE pill comes out, and stops when the sensor detects the falling pill
3. Take your medication -- you’ll be alerted when to take it again!
